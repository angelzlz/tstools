Some tests for the Python binding of the TS tools
=================================================

It's difficult to find example data files that are generally available. For
the moment, I'm going to use a file I have locally, and unfortunately others
will have to manage without. This is still better than no testing...

    >>> test_es_file = '/Users/tibs/sw/tstools/data/aladdin.es'

First, check we've got the basics working:

    >>> from tstools import ESStream
    >>> stream = ESStream(test_es_file)

The filename is available as a "readonly" value:

    >>> stream.filename
    '/Users/tibs/sw/tstools/data/aladdin.es'
